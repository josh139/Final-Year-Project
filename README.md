# Final-Year-Project

Due to technological advancements personal identification systems are becoming more and more common in day to day life. Biometric-based identification techniques bring a 
challenging solution to this problem. Fingerprint recognition is one of the most popular biometric-based techniques used for personal identification.There is therefore 
great demand for a reliable, cost-effective, accurate, and real time automatic fingerprint authentication system (AFAS). For my project I set out to
create this AFAS.

I made the decision to use MATLAB for the development of my application. More specifically I used MATLAB app designer for the implementation of GUIs. I also used the 
image processing toolbox during the enhancement stage of my application.
